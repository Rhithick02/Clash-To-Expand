     			  Clash To Expand

Description:
Clash To Expand is a multi-player deterministic combinatorial/strategical  game in which the player’s objective is to conquer much area and make it his own territory. But it is not as easy as it sounds like. Of course there are certain constraints to make this game more interesting. The field’s dimension is of 10 x 10 and it is divided into 100 square plots of equal area. 
Each player is allotted an infinite number of soldiers so that there wouldn’t be any shortage. Each player takes turn in playing their move and playing their move implies that deploying their soldier in a certain square plot. A player can deploy a soldier in a square plot as many times the plots that are being neighbor to it (neighbor means the plots should share a common side). The player should expand his territory to the neighboring plots (irrespective of whose territory it is and takes control over it) leaving his old territory empty when the no. of. soldiers in a plot equals to the no. of. neighbors. 
The endpoint is simple but it might take a while to reach the endpoint. When a player cannot make a move then the player with less score loses.

Instruction:
    1. Each player must deploy exactly 1 of their soldier every turn to any square plot of his territory or unconquered territory but cannot deploy into enemy territory.
    2. When the no. of. soldiers in a plot reach their limit i.e equal to no. of. neighbors the soldiers should expand to all of their neighbors leaving their own territory empty.
    3. In doing so the soldier conquers the territory even though if it is enemy territory by hypnotizing enemy soldier to fight for them. To be put clearly if there are 2 enemy soldier in one plot and if a soldier enters this territory while expanding the total soldiers in their control will be 3 (including the 2 enemy soldiers).
    4. After expanding if any territory reaches their limit, they again expands as said in 2nd point. 
    5. The objective is to conquer as many plots you could.
    6. The character in the grid says the player who has gained control over that place and the number represents the number of soldiers in it.
